Last revised 15th April 2007


1. Application Overview
-----------------------

The linear regression application generates the summary statistics of points to 
give the linear approximation of all of the points. It reads the x-y coordinates
sequentially from the specified file.


2. Provided Files
-----------------

linear_regression_pthread.c: The pthread version of the application
stddefines.h: Contains declarations of commonly used functions and constants
datafiles/key_file*.txt: Files of various sizes that contain input coordinates. Download the key files from [here](http://csl.stanford.edu/~christos/data/linear_regression.tar.gz)
README: This file


3. Running the Application
--------------------------

run 'clang linear_regression_pthread.c -lpthread -o lreg-pthread' to compile the pthread version of the application. Then, run the following command to run the program

./lreg-pthread <file-name>
